## compile
Written in rust, so you need install rust

The `server` can't run in windows, I test failed  
The `agent` can running in windows, I tested, but linux I don't know

Just change server ip in `agent/src/main.rs 8:37`  
Then compiling both project  
Run server with sudo

```shell
sudo ./server
```

Run agent with administrator privilege

Enjoy shell!
